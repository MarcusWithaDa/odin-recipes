    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound large shrimp</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
      <li>½ small onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 green scallions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced ginger</li>
      <li>1 ½ cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tamari soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the shrimp. In a medium bowl, season the shrimp with the salt and
        pepper. Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the shrimp. Heat 2 tablespoon of avocado oil in a large wok or
        skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the shrimp in a
        single layer and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then flip and cook another 30
        seconds, until just cooked through and opaque. Remove to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the aromatics. Add the onion, white parts of the green onion,
        garlic, and ginger, and stir-fry for a minute, until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the veggies. Add the frozen carrots and peas (no need to thaw), and
        stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes until warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the eggs. Move the veggies to the side, then add the beaten eggs
        and quickly scramble them until they're pillowy soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir-fry the rice, seasoning, and shrimp. Add the rice, shrimp, soy
        sauce, and sesame oil, and stir-fry until the rice and shrimp are warmed
        through, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with green onions. Stir in the green parts of the green onions
        before serving.
      </li>
