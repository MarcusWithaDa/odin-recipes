<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
  <li>2 cans of southwest Corn</li>
  <li>1 can of sweet corn</li>
  <li>1 jalapeno de seeded & diced</li>
  <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
  <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
  <li>1/4 cup finely diced red onion</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
  <li>4 oz block of mild cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>4 oz block of pepper jack cheese</li>
  <li>1 lime juiced</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>⅛ tsp cayenne pepper</li>

  <li>Cotija cheese to top it with</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>With a cheese grater, grate the 4 oz of cheddar cheese and jalapeno pepper cheese. You want them in block form not pre shredded. Pre shredded won't melt as well. Then set aside.</li>
  <li>In crock pot add in cream cheese, frozen corn, jalapeno de seeded & diced, sour cream, mayonnaise, finely diced red onion, garlic cloves minced, shredded cheese, juice of 1 lime, salt, chili powder & cayenne pepper.</li>
  <li>Place on low for 2 hours. Stirring once after 30 minutes and then another time 30 minutes later</li>
  <li>Once the dip is done, stir in cilantro, add to a serving bowl and top with cotija cheese and enjoy!! ( I personally like to add to a bowl instead of eating out of the Crock Pot because I like when the dip cools slightly and becomes thicker! Personal preference)</li>
